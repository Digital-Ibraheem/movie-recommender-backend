# ML Movie Recommendation App

(Yes the design is ugly, at least it works :))

Welcome to the **ML Movie Recommendation App**! This project provides personalized movie recommendations using a **collaborative filtering recommendation system**. Itâ€™s an efficient and interactive way to explore new movies based on your preferences and those of like-minded users.

**NOTE**: It will likely take about a minute for anything to load due to the free server limitations by Render

## ðŸ›  How It Works

1. **Search for a Movie**  
   Start by typing the title of a movie youâ€™re interested in. Our search algorithm dynamically suggests relevant titles, ensuring a seamless search experience.

2. **Get Tailored Recommendations**  
   Once you select a movie, the app identifies users with similar preferences. It then compiles a list of other movies these users enjoyed, delivering tailored recommendations.

3. **Optimized Data Handling**  
   The original ratings dataset was massive (673MB), which posed challenges for processing and performance. Using Python, I filtered the dataset to include only ratings above 3.5, reducing its size to a more manageable 41MB without sacrificing quality.

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```
## ðŸ”§ Challenges Faced
### Large Dataset

- The original ratings file was 673MB, which made it impractical for quick processing.
- Using Python, I filtered the dataset to include only ratings above 3.5, reducing its size to 41MB, significantly improving performance.
  
### Frontend-Backend Integration
- Debugging CORS issues and configuring environment variables for API endpoints required careful testing.
